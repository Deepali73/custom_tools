LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mcontent='You can share a Power BI dashboard without a Pro license, but the options are limited compared to what you can do with a Pro license.  Here\\'s a breakdown of how you can do it, along with the pros and cons of each approach:\\n\\n**1. Sharing with the \"Publish to Web\" Feature (Free License):**\\n\\n* **How it works:** This option lets you embed your dashboard directly into a website or blog.  Anyone with the link can view it, even without a Power BI account.  You control the level of interactivity (e.g., filtering, drilling down).\\n* **Pros:** Simple, free, and great for public-facing dashboards.\\n* **Cons:** Limited interactivity compared to other methods.  No collaboration features.  The dashboard is a static snapshot; data refreshes depend on the data source\\'s schedule.  Security is limited; anyone with the link can access it.\\n* **Best Practices:** Use this only for dashboards you want to be publicly accessible.  Consider data anonymization or aggregation before publishing to protect sensitive information.\\n\\n**2. Sharing with a Power BI Free License (Free License):**\\n\\n* **How it works:**  You can share your report and dashboard with others who also have a free Power BI account. They will need to sign up for a free account if they don\\'t already have one.\\n* **Pros:**  Simpler than setting up a web page.\\n* **Cons:**  Recipients need a Power BI account.  Limited data refresh frequency.  Collaboration features are limited.  Data refresh might be constrained by the free account limitations.\\n\\n**3.  Using a Power BI Pro License (Paid License):**\\n\\n* **How it works:**  With a Pro license, you can share your dashboard with others (who may or may not have Power BI licenses).  They\\'ll get a more interactive experience, including data refreshes based on your data source settings. You can also manage permissions and collaborate more effectively.\\n* **Pros:** Full functionality, collaboration, and data refresh capabilities.\\n* **Cons:** Requires a paid license.\\n\\n**4. Using a Power BI Premium Capacity (Paid License):**\\n\\n* **How it works:** A Power BI Premium capacity allows you to share dashboards with a large number of users without requiring them to have individual Pro licenses.  This is ideal for organizations with many users who need access to dashboards.\\n* **Pros:** Scalable, cost-effective for large organizations, and allows for more robust data governance and security.\\n* **Cons:**  Requires a significant upfront investment.\\n\\n**5. Embedding with Power BI Embedded (Paid Service):**\\n\\n* **How it works:**  This is a cloud-based service that allows you to embed interactive Power BI dashboards into your own applications or websites. It\\'s a more advanced and customizable option.\\n* **Pros:**  Highly customizable, allows for integration with your own applications, and offers more control over security and branding.\\n* **Cons:**  Requires technical expertise to set up and manage, and it\\'s a paid service.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:**\\n\\nIf you need to share a dashboard publicly with minimal interactivity, \"Publish to Web\" is the free option. If you need to share with a small group and don\\'t mind them having Power BI accounts, sharing with free licenses is an option. For full functionality, collaboration, and reliable data refresh, a Pro license or Premium capacity is necessary.  Power BI Embedded is the best option for integrating dashboards into custom applications.
