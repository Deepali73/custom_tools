LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.\n",

Integrated with AWS EC2 for scalable infrastructure provisioning.\\n\\n**Option 2 (Focus on Infrastructure):**\\n\\n* Managed and maintained a fleet of AWS EC2 instances, optimizing resource utilization and reducing infrastructure costs by 15% through automation and right-sizing.  Leveraged Jenkins for automated scaling and patching.\\n\\n**Option 3 (Focus on Problem Solving):**\\n\\n* Resolved critical production incidents by leveraging Jenkins and AWS EC2 monitoring tools, resulting in a 99.99% uptime for key applications.  Implemented automated rollback procedures to minimize downtime.\\n\\n**Option 4 (Focus on Specific Tools/Technologies within Jenkins & AWS):**\\n\\n* Implemented and maintained Jenkins pipelines using Groovy scripting, incorporating automated testing and deployment to AWS EC2 instances via Ansible.  Utilized AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.\\n\\n**Option 5 (More Junior Level -  If limited experience):**\\n\\n* Assisted in the deployment and configuration of applications to AWS EC2 instances using Jenkins.  Gained experience with CI/CD principles and AWS infrastructure management.\\n\\n\\n**To make these even better, consider adding:**\\n\\n* **Specific numbers:** Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible (e.g., reduced deployment time by X%, increased efficiency by Y%).\\n* **Action verbs:** Start your bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., automated, implemented, optimized, resolved).\\n* **Keywords:** Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description.\\n* **Context:** Briefly explain the context of your work (e.g., \"for a high-traffic e-commerce platform\").\\n\\n\\nRemember to tailor your bullet points to the specific requirements and keywords mentioned in the target job description.
